What I learned

I really struggle with the hover state of the card image it took me a while to understand how to do it but at the end it was worth it because I manage to resolve it and succeed with the challenge.

Meanwhile I keep working my CSS and HTML skills to improve everyday, at this point I can easily understand and manage errors.
